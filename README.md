**SpeedSketch** is a free app for creating timed drawing sessions using photo references on your own
device. It displays all images in a given collection one by one, each for a specified amount of time.
Perfect for gesture studies, figure drawing practice, and the like!

_Available as a [web app][Webapp] and a [desktop app](#desktop-app) for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**._

## Features

### Create your own drawing session

- **Personal photo references:** Choose any folder on your device to use as a photo reference source.
- **Custom session schedule:** Choose a fixed display time in **Endless Mode**, or create your own schedule in **Class Mode**.
- **Randomize image order:** Choose whether to display images alphabetically or in a random order.

### Image Viewing

- **Zoom/pan:** Scroll to zoom in and out, and click & drag to pan around the image.
- **Flip horizontally or vertically:** Flip the image for more variety.
- **Customizable image filters:** Use the **Greyscale**, **High Contrast**, and **Blur** filters to focus on shape
  and form.
- **Pin window to top** _(desktop version only)_: Keep the app window on top of other windows for easy reference while
  drawing.
- **Show image folder** _(desktop version only)_: Reveal the image in your systemâ€™s file navigator.
- **Light & dark themes**

# SpeedSketch: Timed Drawing App

**[Download (Mac + Windows)](https://github.com/AvaLovelace1/speed-sketch/releases/latest)**

**NOTE FOR MAC USERS:** Mac may prevent the app from opening for the first time, as it is from an unidentified developer. To bypass this problem, right-click the app, select `Open`, and click `Open` on the dialog that pops up.

**SpeedSketch** is a free app that allows you to create timed drawing sessions using photo references on your own
computerâ€”perfect for gesture studies, figure drawing practice, and the like.
It was inspired by [GestureDrawing!](https://cubebrush.co/advanches/products/d9q6yq/gesturedrawing?q=gesturedrawing)
and [Quickposes](https://quickposes.com/en/desktop-app).

Given an input folder, SpeedSketch scans the folder for images. It then displays them one by one in a
random order, each for a specified amount of time.
